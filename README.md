rscript
============

rscript is a simple scheme-like parser which was intended to be used in a openGL engine project. rcythrScript (and the engine) are currently unfinished, but are a good starting point for a scheme-like implementation which allows for code structures to be constructed at compile or startup of an application and then used on different threads simultaneously.
